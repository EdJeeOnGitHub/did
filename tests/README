Running test cases:

- Either step through R markdown files directly (useful when writing new code)

- Create html file by running `rmarkdown::render` on each .Rmd file in the folder; results shoud be easy to interpret


Description of files in `tests` folder:

- fast_sims.Rmd -- These are detailed simulations that our point estimates appear to be correct.  They run relatively quickly and are a good way to quickly to test code.

- slow_sims.Rmd -- These are simulations to test the inference procedures of our approach (but do not include tests of the conditional moment pre-testing functions).  Therefore, these should be run, at least before releasing a new version of the package.

- pretest_sims.Rmd -- These simulations are extremely slow.  They test the conditional pre-testing functions.  These functions do have some dependencies on the main code, but the dependencies are small.  These simulations only need to be run when changes to conditional pre-testing code have been made.

- setup_sims.R -- Contains functions for building datasets used in the simulations.

- fast_sims.R -- can be deleted (migrated to R markdown version)

- slow_sims.R -- can be deleted (migrated to R markdown version)

- pretest_sims.R -- can be deleted (migrated to R markdown version)
