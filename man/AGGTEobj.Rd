\arguments{
\item{overall.att}{The estimated overall ATT}

\item{overall.se}{Standard error for overall ATT}

\item{type}{Which type of aggregated treatment effect parameter.
Possibilities are "simple" (the default), "dynamic" (for dynamic effects /
event studies), "selective" (for selective treatment timing / group
specific treatment effects), and "calendar" (for time effects)}

\item{egt}{Holds the length of exposure (for dynamic effects), the
group (for selective treatment timing), or the time period (for calendar
time effects)}

\item{att.egt}{The ATT specific to egt}

\item{se.egt}{The standard error specific to egt}

\item{crit.val.egt}{A critical value for computing uniform confidence
bands for dynamic effects, selective treatment timing, or time period
effects.}

\item{inf.function}{The influence function of the chosen aggregated parameters}
}
\value{
an AGGTEobj

\description{
Objects of this class hold results on aggregated
 group-time average treatment effects

An object for holding aggregated treatment effect parameters.
