\arguments{
\item{data}{The name of the data.frame that contains the data}

\item{first.treat.name}{The name of the variable in \code{data} that contains the first
period when a particular observation is treated.  This should be a positive
number for all observations in treated groups.  It should be 0 for observations
in the untreated group.}

\item{outcome}{The outcome y (in quotations, always!)}

\item{tname}{The name of the column containing the time periods}

\item{idname}{The individual (cross-sectional unit) id name}

\item{method}{The method for estimating the propensity score when covariates
are included (not implemented)}

\item{seedvec}{Optional value to set random seed; can possibly be used
in conjunction with bootstrapping standard errors#' (not implemented)}

\item{pl}{Boolean for whether or not to use parallel processing (not implemented) is TRUE.}

\item{cores}{The number of cores to use for parallel processing (not implemented)}

\item{printdetails}{Boolean for showing detailed results or not}

\item{nevertreated}{Boolean for using the group which is never treated in the sample as the comparison unit. Default is TRUE.}

\item{het}{The name of the column containing the (binary) categories for heterogeneity}
}
\value{
a list with length equal to the number of groups times the
 number of time periods; each element of the list contains an
 object that contains group-time average treamtent effect as well
 as which group it is for and which time period it is for. It also exports
 the influence function which is used externally to compute
 standard errors.
}
\description{
\code{compute.att_gt_het} does the main work for computing
 mutliperiod group-time average treatment effects with heterogeneity
