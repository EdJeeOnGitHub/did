\usage{
reset.sim(time.periods = 4, n = 5000, p = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{time.periods}{The number of time periods to include}

\item{n}{The total number of observations}

\item{p}{The probability of being treated}
}
\value{
list of simulation parameters
}
\description{
a function to create a "reasonable" set of parameters
to create simulated panel data that obeys a parallel trends assumption.
In particular, it provides parameters where the the effect of participating
in the treatment is equal to one in all post-treatment time periods.

After calling this function, the user can change particular values of the
parameters in order to generate dynamics, heterogeneous effects across
groups, etc.
