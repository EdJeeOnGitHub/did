}
\arguments{
\item{outcome}{The outcome y (in quotations, always!)}

\item{data}{The name of the data.frame that contains the data}

\item{tname}{The name of the column containing the time periods}

\item{idname}{The individual (cross-sectional unit) id name}

\item{first.treat.name}{The name of the variable in \code{data} that contains the first
period when a particular observation is treated.  This should be a positive
number for all observations in treated groups.  It should be 0 for observations
in the untreated group.}

\item{nevertreated}{Boolean for using the group which is never treated in the sample as the comparison unit. Default is TRUE.}

\item{het}{The name of the column containing the (binary) categories for heterogeneity}

\item{aggte}{boolean for whether or not to compute aggregate treatment effect parameters, default TRUE}

\item{maxe}{maximum values of periods ahead to be computed in event study. Only used if aggte = T.}

\item{mine}{minimum values of periods ahead to be computed in event study. Only used if aggte = T.}

\item{w}{The name of the column containing the sampling weights. If not set, all observations have same weight.}

\item{alp}{the significance level, default is 0.05}

\item{bstrap}{Boolean for whether or not to compute standard errors using
the multiplier boostrap.  If standard errors are clustered, then one
must set \code{bstrap=TRUE}. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{biters}{The number of boostrap iterations to use.  The default is 1000,
and this is only applicable if \code{bstrap=TRUE}.}

\item{clustervars}{A vector of variables to cluster on.  At most, there
can be two variables (otherwise will throw an error) and one of these
must be the same as idname which allows for clustering at the individual
level.}

\item{cband}{Boolean for whether or not to compute a uniform confidence
band that covers all of the group-time average treatment effects
with fixed probability \code{1-alp}.  The default is \code{TRUE}
and the resulting standard errors will be pointwise.}

\item{printdetails}{Boolean for showing detailed results or not}

\item{seedvec}{Optional value to set random seed; can possibly be used
in conjunction with bootstrapping standard errors#' (not implemented)}

\item{pl}{Boolean for whether or not to use parallel processing (not implemented) is TRUE.}

\item{cores}{The number of cores to use for parallel processing (not implemented)}

\item{method}{The method for estimating the propensity score when covariates
are included (not implemented)}

\description{
\code{att_gt_het2} computes the difference of average treatment effects across two subpopulations
in DID setups where there are more than two periods of data and
allowing for treatment to occur at different points in time. Here, we assume same trends
between the two supopulations. See Marcus ans Sant'Anna (2020) for a detailed description.
