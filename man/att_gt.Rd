\arguments{
\item{yname}{The name of the outcome variable}

\item{tname}{The name of the column containing the time periods}

\item{idname}{The individual (cross-sectional unit) id name}

\item{first.treat.name}{The name of the variable in \code{data} that
contains the first period when a particular observation is treated.
This should be a positive number for all observations in treated groups.
It defines which "group" a unit belongs to.  It should be 0 for units
in the untreated group.}

\item{xformla}{A formula for the covariates to include in the
model.  It should be of the form \code{~ X1 + X2}.  Default
is NULL which is equivalent to \code{xformla=~1}.  This is
used to create a matrix of covariates which is then passed
to the 2x2 DID estimator chosen in \code{estMethod}.}

\item{data}{The name of the data.frame that contains the data}

\item{panel}{Whether or not the data is a panel dataset.
The panel dataset should be provided in long format -- that
is, where each row corresponds to a unit observed at a
particular point in time.  The default is TRUE.  When
is using a panel dataset, the variable \code{idname} must
be set.  When \code{panel=FALSE}, the data is treated
as repeated cross sections.}

\item{control.group}{Which units to use the control group.
The default is "nevertreated" which sets the control group
to be the group of units that never participate in the
treatment.  This group does not change across groups or
time periods.  The other option is to set
\code{group="notyettreated"}.  In this case, the control group
is set to the group of units that have not yet participated
in the treatment in that time period.  This includes all
never treated units, but it includes additional units that
eventually participate in the treatment, but have not
participated yet.}

\item{weightsname}{The name of the column containing the sampling weights.
If not set, all observations have same weight.}

\item{alp}{the significance level, default is 0.05}

\item{bstrap}{Boolean for whether or not to compute standard errors using
the multiplier boostrap.  If standard errors are clustered, then one
must set \code{bstrap=TRUE}. Default is \code{FALSE} and analytical
standard errors are reported.}

\item{cband}{Boolean for whether or not to compute a uniform confidence
 band that covers all of the group-time average treatment effects
 with fixed probability \code{1-alp}.  In order to compute uniform confidence
 bands, \code{bstrap} must also be set to \code{TRUE}.  The default is
\code{FALSE} and the resulting standard errors will be pointwise.}

\item{biters}{The number of boostrap iterations to use.  The default is 1000,
and this is only applicable if \code{bstrap=TRUE}.}

\item{clustervars}{A vector of variables to cluster on.  At most, there
can be two variables (otherwise will throw an error) and one of these
must be the same as idname which allows for clustering at the individual
level.}

\item{estMethod}{the method to compute group-time average treatment effects.  The default is "dr" which uses the doubly robust
approach in the \code{DRDID} package.  Other built-in methods
include "ipw" for inverse probability weighting and "reg" for
first step regression estimators.  The user can also pass their
own function for estimating group time average treatment
effects.  This should be a function
\code{f(Y1,Y0,treat,covariates)} where \code{Y1} is an
\code{n} x \code{1} vector of outcomes in the post-treatment
outcomes, \code{Y0} is an \code{n} x \code{1} vector of
pre-treatment outcomes, \code{treat} is a vector indicating
whether or not an individual participates in the treatment,
and \code{covariates} is an \code{n} x \code{k} matrix of
covariates.  The function should return a list that includes
\code{ATT} (an estimated average treatment effect), and
\code{inf.func} (an \code{n} x \code{1} influence function).
The function can return other things as well, but these are
the only two that are required. \code{estMethod} is only used
if covariates are included.}

\item{printdetails}{Boolean for showing detailed results or not}

\item{pl}{Boolean for whether or not to use parallel processing
(not implemented yet)}

\item{cores}{The number of cores to use for parallel processing
(not implemented yet)}

\item{nevertreated}{did currently provides two possibilities for the
control group.  The first one is to use the group of units that are never
participate in the treatment.  This is the default behavior and occurs
when nevertreated=TRUE.  In the case where there is no group that is never
treated, att_gt will use the group that is treated in the last period and
provide a warning.  The other possible control group is the "not yet
treated" group.  This is a larger group and includes both never treated
units and units that have not yet (but eventually will) participate in the
treatment.  This control group changes across different time periods.}

\description{
\code{att_gt} computes average treatment effects in DID
 setups where there are more than two periods of data and allowing for
 treatment to occur at different points in time and allowing for
 treatment effect heterogeneity and dynamics.
 See Callaway and Sant'Anna (2019) for a detailed description.
